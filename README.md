## Trouble On The Horizon: An Examination of the Physicality of Black Holes

Welcome! This is an experiment of sorts, requesting feedback on a research manuscript on the topic of black holes using GitHub.

## Abstract
This paper examines the philosophical and theoretical challenges posed by black holes, with a
particular focus on contradictions arising from the event horizon in general relativity and
quantum mechanics. It reviews prominent alternative models—fuzzballs, gravastars, and
quantum stars—and proposes a novel hypothesis, the Oppenheimer-Snyder frozen star, which
resolves these issues through a reinterpretation of gravitational collapse.
